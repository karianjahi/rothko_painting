## 🖼️ Description

The painting is composed of a bordered `.frame` that contains a `.canvas`, which holds three abstract color fields (`.one`, `.two`, and `.three`). These rectangles simulate Rothko’s signature blurred, emotional, and color-rich artworks.

### 🔧 Techniques Used

- **HTML** semantic structure
- **CSS transforms** for slight rotations
- **Box shadows** to simulate color bleeding
- **Filter blur** to create Rothko's soft, layered texture
- **Border radius** for organic feel
- **Pure CSS styling** — no external images or JS

### ✅ How to Use

- Copy this into your `README.md` file as-is.
- GitHub or any markdown viewer will render it as a **code block**, not as formatted headings and sections.
- If you want it to look **visually like a code box** but still keep headings and formatting, you’d need to style it differently using HTML/CSS — not markdown.
